## Introduction
This was a challenge to see if I could implement Spotify authentication as well as a lyrics look up to improve upon the basic features already included with the Spotify Web Player.

## Setup
- run ```npm i&& npm start```

Navigate to /server and add a .env file

```
REDIRECT_URI=https://localhost:3000/
CLIENT_ID=(YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID)
CLIENT_SECRET=(YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET)
PORT=5000
```
